			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<p>Blops is a great way to chill out, watch netflix, and then drop the hammer on somebody's <app-quick-def defModal="bigShiny"><span item-name class="capitalize">shiny</span></app-quick-def>. While these fleets are mostly relaxed, they do require some discipline, obedience, and know-how. <app-quick-def defModal="bridgeShip"><span item-name class="capitalize">The Bridge Ship</span></app-quick-def> itself is worth around 3B and will in many cases be under combat scan pressure. Mistakes can be expensive, but are very very avoidable.</p>
			<p>This guide will help you understand how to fly in a <app-quick-def defModal="blopsShip"><span item-name class="capitalize">blops ship</span></app-quick-def>, and minimize mistakes. The most important thing is to listen to your FC and be patient. Undocking or warping around when not being told to can lead to being station camped in the lightest of circumstances to accidentally decloaking the bridge and losing it.</p>

						<p>If you do not have your own ship, I can provide ships. You can also keep a clone there if you'd like, but make sure you are early to the fleet so I can hand you your ship.</p>

			<h2>FC Wat Do?</h2>
			<p>Once you have a ship from the FC, undock and cloak in a <app-quick-def defModal="safe"><span item-name class="capitalize">Safe</span></app-quick-def></p>
			<p>Do not ever warp to the <app-quick-def defModal="bridgeShip"><span item-name class="capitalize">Bridger</span></app-quick-def> unless instructed to.</p>
			<p>If instructed to warp to the <app-quick-def defModal="bridgeShip"><span item-name class="capitalize">Bridger</span></app-quick-def>, <span class="bold">Cloak First, Then Warp.</span></p>

						<label class="step">1</label>

					<div class="step-content">
						<label>Undock</label>
						<p>You should already be undocked and in space unless your FC say's otherwise. Make sure you are cloaked.</p>

						<label>Get on the Bridge</label>
						<p>When your FC tell's you to warp to the <app-quick-def defModal="bridgeShip"><span item-name class="capitalize">Bridger</span></app-quick-def>, first ensure that you are cloaked and then warp to the bridge at 0.</p> 
						<p>Now wait for further instructions. This could be a long wait. Be patient. If at any point you realize you've been drifting, inform the FC that you need to warp off and back. Warp away and then warp back to the bridge at 0.</p>

						<label>Wait for Hunters</label>
						<p>When our <app-quick-def defModal="hunters"><span item-name class="capitalize">Hunters</span></app-quick-def> find a target, they will call that they are in warp. At this point, wake up and get ready to <app-quick-def defModal="takingTheBridge"><span item-name class="capitalize">Jump Through The Bridge</span></app-quick-def>. <span class="bold">Do not decloak</span>.

						<label>Bridge</label>
						<p>Once one of our hunters successfully tackles a target, a cyno will be lit. The bridge will decloak open a bridge and say <span class="bold">"Take the bridge"</span>.

						<label>Attack</label>
						<p>When you appear on grid, there will be a <app-quick-def defModal="bigShiny"><span item-name class="capitalize">Big Shiny</span></app-quick-def> in front of you. Before you attack it there are some things you need to do. <app-quick-def defModal="alignCelestial"><span item-name class="capitalize">Align towards a celestial that is <span class="bold">not</span> in the direction of the target</span></app-quick-def>. Now you can lock up the target, turn on your target painter or disrupter, and fire your torpedos. If you take damage, warp to your align immediately. Make a bookmark on the way out. When you land, you can warp back to the fleet and align to your bookmark.</p>

						<label>Escape if needed</label>
						<p>If the target lights a cyno, be very ready to warp. If ships come through the cyno warp immediately to your align. Make a <app-quick-def defModal="safe"><span item-name class="capitalize">Safe</span></app-quick-def>, and cloak up.</p>

						<label>Destroy</label>
						<p>When we kill a target the FC will call to warp off grid. Warp to your align, and make a <app-quick-def defModal="alignCelestial"><span item-name class="capitalize">Safe</span></app-quick-def> mid warp. Reload and repair while warping and then cloak. You do not need to wait for the reload to finish to cloak. Warp to your <app-quick-def defModal="alignCelestial"><span item-name class="capitalize">Safe</span></app-quick-def> and await further instructions. If the kill site is safe, the Astero pilots will loot. Loot goes to corp as it funds SRP and ship provisions.</p>

						<label>Reset</label>
						<p>The <app-quick-def defModal="bridgeShip"><span item-name class="capitalize">Bridger</span></app-quick-def> needs to reset. Just hang out cloaked in your safe spot for now. Once the bridge resets, we will basically do what we just did all over again.</p>
