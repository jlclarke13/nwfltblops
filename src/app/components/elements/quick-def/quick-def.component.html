	<div class="content">
		<p>A spot in space that cannot be warped to from the overview. The safe spot should be preferably not inline with anything, however the importance of this depends on what you are flying. For the purpose of this fleet, it is ok if the safe is inline with a celestial.</p>
		<p>To make a safe, you can use <span class="bold">ctrl + b</span> to open the bookmark dialogue. You can do this while warping. The bookmark will save on submit, so you can time that however you like.</p>
